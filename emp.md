## Repository naming convention
- Microservice should have suffix service
- Backend for frontend should have suffix backend
- Frontend should have suffix frontend
- API gateway should have suffix gateway
- If there is only one word preceeding a suffix then do not shorten it (e.g.: search-service, recruitment-service)
- If there are more than one word preceeding a suffix then take the first letters and combine them as the first word (e.g.: hrm-frontend, am-service)
- The Github Description when creating a new repository should contain fully expanded names (e.g.: HR management or even Human resource management service)
- The same expanded name should appear in the Readme below the repository name
